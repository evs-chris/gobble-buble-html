# gobble-buble-html

Do you like to put JavaScript in script tags in your HTML? Do you like to use ES2015 features? Do you like to stay older-browser friendly?

Well then good news! This [gobble](http://github.com/gobblejs/gobble) plugin will hunt through your HTML sources, find any plain scripts and scripts with type text/javascript, use Buble to transpile the ES2015, and dump it back into the tag as ES5.
